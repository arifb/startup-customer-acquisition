<h3>About</h3>
<p>
  Hi, I'm <a href="http://arifb.com">Arif</a>. My goal for this site is to curate and summarize all the beautiful content out there focused on acquiring customers for your startup. I hope to save you from random googling and provide actionable tasks that you can put into place. In my humble opinion, if a startup has already created a product that people want, acquisition is one of the two biggest problems remaining (the other being customer retention). I will always provide sources unless the content comes from my own experience. Feedback and requests for content are welcome, email me at arif+at+arifb.com.</p>
