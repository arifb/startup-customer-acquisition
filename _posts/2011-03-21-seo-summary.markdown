There are many on-page optimizations one can do to increase a site ranking, summarized "TODO: relevant anchor text, link" [here](/) however the general consensus is that inbound links combined with high quality, relevant content will trump anything else you can do. 

### Content
Attempting to build content without a scalable strategy is a tough game to play, one that is very time consuming. Some techniques to leverage the time you and your team put into generating content and turning that time into results are below:
* Using code to generate pages that contain long-tail keywords, detailed in the post [Scalable Content Generation](TODO: link)
* Creating microsites that focus on long-tail keywords, also detailed in the above linked post
* Outsourcing writing: Writers are fairly cheap however finding good ones with some domain expertise is not super easy. Some places to look are applicable forums and even the English department at your local University. Services such as [TextBroker](http://textbroker.com) help you find content for your domain and provide a marketplace to contract writers.

The best kind of content is that which is evergreen, meaning it will not expire over time. Answering common questions about your domain space is a great example - those that are relatively new to what you do often have very similar questions - write some high quality copy catering to them. Another great candidate for content is around data that your product provides through its day to day operation. For example, a couple friends have just launched an [online booking calendar catering on soloists](http://easycalapp.com) such as hairdressers. Through their app they may have data that very few have such as the percentage of hairdressers that are frustrated with their current booking software and thus do most scheduling manually (weak example but let's just carry on). Centering a blog post around this sort of thing could be beneficial for their SEO given very few others have this data. 

### Links
I have not written much about getting inbound links. Some would say that if you provide high quality content, the links will come. However there are definitely some techniques you can use to market said content and increase your chances to acquire links. A great resource for beginning to think about this is an old post [on seomoz about your linkerati](http://www.seomoz.org/blog/every-site-is-linkbait-linkerati-worthy). In a nutshell,
