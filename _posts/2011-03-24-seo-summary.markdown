There are many on-page optimizations one can do to increase a site ranking however the general consensus is that inbound links combined with high-quality, relevant content will trump anything else you can do. 

## Content
Attempting to build content without a scalable strategy is a tough game to play, one that is very time consuming. Some techniques to leverage the time you and your team put into generating content and turning that time into results are below:

* Use code to generate pages that contain long-tail keywords, detailed in the post [Scalable Content Generation](/2011/03/19/seo-increase-ranking-organically-scalable-content-generation-1/)
* Create microsites that focus on long-tail keywords, also detailed in the above linked post
* Outsource writing: Writers are fairly cheap however finding good ones with some domain expertise is not easy. Some places to look are influential users on online forums in your space and even the English department at your local University. Services such as [TextBroker](http://textbroker.com) help you find content for your domain and provide a marketplace to contract writers.

The best kind of content is that which is evergreen, meaning it will not expire over time. Answering common questions about your domain space is a great example - those that are relatively new to what you do often have very similar questions - write some high quality copy catering to them. Another great candidate for content is that which is based around data that your product provides through its day-to-day operation. For example, a couple friends have just launched an [online booking calendar catering to soloists](http://easycalapp.com) such as hairdressers. Through their app they may have access to data that very few others have such as the percentage of hairdressers that are frustrated with their current booking software and thus do most scheduling manually. Centering a blog post around this topic could be beneficial for their SEO given very few others have this data. 

## Links
Some say that if you provide high quality content, the links will come. However there are definitely some techniques you can use to market said content and increase your chances to acquire links. A great resource for beginning to think about this is an old post [on SEOmoz about your linkerati](http://www.seomoz.org/blog/every-site-is-linkbait-linkerati-worthy). In a nutshell:

* Brainstorm about who is most likely to provide a link to you. Bloggers and forum communities in your space are obvious ones to start with but try to think outside the box. For example, research whether complimentary products and their communities are worth expending effort on.
* Submit to a few high-quality site directories. Here is a list of [25 supposedly good ones](http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/top-25-most-powerful-web-directories-list.html).
* Provide architecture on your site that allows others to add content, at the very least a commenting system on your blog. These contributors may link to this content.

However, above all, focus on your content and making sure it is both serving a need and is well-written.
