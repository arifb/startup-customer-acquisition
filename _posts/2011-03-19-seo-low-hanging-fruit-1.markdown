### SEO - Low Hanging Fruit

With each category of Customer Acquisition, I hope to have 1 or more posts in the 'Low Hanging Fruit' realm - just stuff that you can do simply and quickly, as opposed to full strategies/techniques, that will increase your acquisition metrics. Here it is for SEO - much of this stuff is common sense and what it really boils down to is having relevant and high-quality content that others will want to link to. Having inbound links from other high-quality sites will trump all other SEO.

**On-Page Factors that are Keyword specific:**

* Using keywords in title tags
* Using keywords in heading tags
* Using keywords in domain name, subdomain name, page name, or page folder
* Using keywords in internal (to another page on your site) and external link anchor text
* Using keywords in first 50-100 words in HTML text on page
* Repeating keywords in HTML text


**On-Page Factors, Non-Keyword specific:**

* The most important of all, writing relevant, unique content
* Freshness of page, was it created/updated recently


**Inbound Link Factors:**

* Keyword focused anchor text from external links
* How popular the sites are that are linking to you
* Diversity of link sources; you want links from many unique domains
 
Of course this is just a subset of the complete list; and few, if any, have the complete list save Google. I've tried to highlight the ones that are universally regarded as important.

There are numerous negative ranking factors as well; attempting to manipulate Google may work for a time but if/when they find you out, you will get buried. Just not worth it. See the SEOmoz source post linked below if you want to learn about these factors.
