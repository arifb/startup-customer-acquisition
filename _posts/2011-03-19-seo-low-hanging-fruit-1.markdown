### SEO - Low Hanging Fruit

With each category of Customer Acquisition, I hope to have 1 or more posts in the 'Low Hanging Fruit' realm - Just stuff that you can do very simply and quickly, as opposed to full strategies/techniques, that will increase your acquisition metrics. Here it is for SEO - much of this stuff is common sense and what it really boils down to is having relevant and high-quality content that others will want to link to. Having links that point to your site from other high-quality sites will trump all other SEO.

* On-Page Factors that are Keyword specific
  * Using keywords in title tags
  * Using keywords in heading tags
  * Using keywords in internal (to another page on your site) and external link anchor text
  * Using keywords in image tags alt text
  * Using keywords in the meta tags

* On-Page Factors, Non-Keyword specific
  * The most important of all, the writing relevant, unique content
  * Freshness of page, was it created recently
